# Upgrading Nimbus

If you're using Nimbus 2021.11.0 or later, you should be able to use its integrated updater functionality.

Below are manual upgrading instructions for older versions:

## Upgrading Roborock Vacuums

### S5, V1 and S6

If you're using an S5 or V1, the recommended way to upgrade Nimbus is to flash a new image. This requires you to have SSH access to the robot.

1. Select the `Build for manual installation (requires SSH to install)` option in the [Dustbuilder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/). You will then receive a link to a tar.gz archive by email.
2. Login to your robot via SSH.
3. Download the tar.gz file to the `/mnt/data` folder and extract it:
```sh
cd /mnt/data
wget <url to tar from dustbuilder>
tar xzf <file.tar.gz>
```
4. The robot has two systems, you cannot update a system whilst it is in use. You will be in system A by default, allowing you to update system B. Update system B (from system A) then reboot into system B:
```sh
./install_b.sh
reboot
```
5. Reconnect to your robot via SSH. You'll now be in system B, allowing you to update system A. Update system A (from system B) then reboot back into system A for normal operation:
```sh
cd /mnt/data
./install_a.sh
rm -f <file.tar.gz>
reboot
```

Your robot should now be running the latest version.

You can also stop the Nimbus service by running `/etc/init/S11nimbus stop`, and then replace the binary via scp + reboot or restart the service.

Just make sure that you try a full reflash **if you encounter any issues such as "No Map Data" or disappearing settings**.

If you don't have ssh available, you will need to do a full factory reset to re-enable OTA updates on supported robots, and then follow the initial installation procedure.


## Upgrading Dreame vacuums

1. SSH into the vacuum and kill nimbus: `killall nimbus`
2. Replace the old Nimbus binary in `/data/nimbus` with the new one
   - `wget https://github.com/NimbusVacuum/Nimbus/releases/latest/download/nimbus-{armv7,armv7-lowmem,aarch64} -O /data/nimbus`
   - Make sure to use the correct binary as documented in the [supported robots](https://nimbus.cleaning/pages/general/supported-robots.html) section
   - If you get a "Text file busy" error, it means Nimbus is still running. Try to kill it again.
   - If the issue still occurs, delete the old binary before uploading the new one
3. Reboot your vacuum: `reboot`
