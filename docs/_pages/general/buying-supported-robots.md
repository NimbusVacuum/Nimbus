# Buying Supported Robots

The recommended source to buy a [supported robot](https://nimbus.cleaning/pages/general/supported-robots.html) is
wherever it is cheapest. In general, when buying something, you should always use price comparison websites, shopping communities, check Aliexpress etc.

## Recommendation

For your convenience, here's a short list of recommendations (updated 2022-11-23).

**Note:**
This list only features robots that can be fairly easy to root depending on the firmware they're running.
They're also ranked based on desirability due to features, performance, etc.

For buying a new robot, the best options would be the these:

- Dreame Z10 Pro

If you need proper mopping, consider these:

- Dreame W10 (not the Pro!)

If you're on a budget, you could also consider buying one of these:
